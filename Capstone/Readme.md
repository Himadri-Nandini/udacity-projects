# Udacity-MLND-Capstone-Breast-Cancer-Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques
Machine Learning is used in a wide variety of fields today. In this project machine learning techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, XGB Classifier, Support vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting are used to build a model that can predict whether a person suffers from breast cancer or not. Breast Cancer is a cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. Breast Cancer is highly predominant in women in today's world. It is caused by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the breast. It can start in the breast and can spread to other areas of the body in the course of time.
